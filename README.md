##Programmer's Proverbs

Programming and development often teaches one wisdom that cannot be attained elsewhere. Coding and programming, as some have said, is a way of life, not just job. When you are a coder, that is a big part of who you are at work and outside of work. So, let's come together, and put down our wisdom for future generations to see and learn from.

##The Rules
Given that I've been getting a great number of pull requests and submissions, I wanted to write down a quick FAQ and rulebook.

1. **Are programming wisdoms allowed?** No, not really. These are supposed to be wisdoms and proverbs about life taken from programming. While a "proverb" like `Use semantic class names that are easy to read and understand` sounds great for a programmer, it misses the point of the repo. It can be rewritten as such `Write classnames so others can understand the wisdom of your code` which makes sense outside of coding as well: work and communicate in such a way so that others can understand what you mean and the wisdom behind your work.
2. **Can I submit someone else's quotes?** No. Please submit your own ideas. You're welcome to look up regular (non-programming) proverbs and translate them as I did with `A deployed MVP is worth two prototyped`. Use your own ideas please!
3. **Should I include my name in the quote?** You're welcome to do a `- by Me` tag after the quote. That will ensure that even after I restructure the readme file, you'll still get credit!
4. **Is my quote always going to be here?** Probably not but I will build out a `legacy.README.md` where I will store any discarded quotes.

##API
For those that feel like they want to hit up an API and get a list of proverbs (or a single proverb), I crafted this neat little API. Here's how it works:

***

####Quantity of attempts often yields quality at the end. Commitment to refactoring legacy code yields better quality yet.

***

####Accept that some days you're the QA and some days you're the one fixing bugs.

***

####Give a programmer the correct code and he can do his work for a day. Teach a programmer to debug and he can do his work for a lifetime - by Chirag Gude

***

####Figure out your data structures, and the code will follow.

***

####One thing should never do more than one thing.

***

####An open source developer does not act for personal fame.

***

##Programmer's Proverbs

Programming and development often teaches one wisdom that cannot be attained elsewhere. Coding and programming, as some have said, is a way of life, not just job. When you are a coder, that is a big part of who you are at work and outside of work. So, let's come together, and put down our wisdom for future generations to see and learn from.

##The Rules
Given that I've been getting a great number of pull requests and submissions, I wanted to write down a quick FAQ and rulebook.

1. **Are programming wisdoms allowed?** No, not really. These are supposed to be wisdoms and proverbs about life taken from programming. While a "proverb" like `Use semantic class names that are easy to read and understand` sounds great for a programmer, it misses the point of the repo. It can be rewritten as such `Write classnames so others can understand the wisdom of your code` which makes sense outside of coding as well: work and communicate is such a way so that others can understand what you mean and the wisdom behind your work. 
2. **Can I submit someone else's quotes?** No. Please submit your own ideas. You're welcome to look up regular (non-programming) proverbs and translate them as I did with `A deployed MVP is worth two prototyped`. Use your own ideas please!
3. **Should I include my name in the quote?** You're welcome to do a `- by Me` tag after the quote. That will ensure that even after I restructure the readme file, you'll still get credit!
4. **Is my quote always going to be here?** Probably not but I will build out a `legacy.README.md` where I will store any discarded quotes.

####Customers are the best testers.

***

####Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." --Brian Kernighan

***

####Absence is beauty, in error logs.

***

####Eternal sunshine of the stateless mind

***

####Laziness is your best friend.  Never do twice what you can automate once.

###Architecture and design are preparations for problems and changes, not a key to runtime.

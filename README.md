##Programmer's Proverbs

Programming and development often teaches one wisdom that cannot be attained elsewhere. Coding and programming, as some have said, is a way of life, not just job. When you are a coder, that is a big part of who you are at work and outside of work. So, let's come together, and put down our wisdom for future generations to see and learn from.

##The Rules
Given that I've been getting a great number of pull requests and submissions, I wanted to write down a quick FAQ and rulebook.

1. **Are programming wisdoms allowed?** No, not really. These are supposed to be wisdoms and proverbs about life taken from programming. While a "proverb" like `Use semantic class names that are easy to read and understand` sounds great for a programmer, it misses the point of the repo. It can be rewritten as such `Write classnames so others can understand the wisdom of your code` which makes sense outside of coding as well: work and communicate is such a way so that others can understand what you mean and the wisdom behind your work. 
2. **Can I submit someone else's quotes?** No. Please submit your own ideas. You're welcome to look up regular (non-programming) proverbs and translate them as I did with `A deployed MVP is worth two prototyped`. Use your own ideas please!
3. **Should I include my name in the quote?** You're welcome to do a `- by Me` tag after the quote. That will ensure that even after I restructure the readme file, you'll still get credit!
4. **Is my quote always going to be here?** Probably not but I will build out a `legacy.README.md` where I will store any discarded quotes.

####Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it." --Brian Kernighan

####Absence is beauty, in error logs.

***

####Eternal sunshine of the stateless mind

***

####Laziness is your best friend.  Never do twice what you can automate once.

####Baking a cake is a science; decorating cakes is an art; some people are better at one, than the other; but you can't really do much with the icing, until the cake is out of the oven; try it and you'll either get burned OR end up with a big gooey mess.. and, even though we can put your kid's picture on the cake doesn't mean we have to... sometimes maybe it's better to figure out the recipe before we discuss the sprinkles. Agile software development is no different than planning a child's birthday. You start with: "How many people are going to be at the party?", and then you figure out "WHO is gonna bring WHAT to the table? and WHEN!" Everything else is simply a matter of taste... - Joe Negron ~ NYC
